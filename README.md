# Real Favicon Generator for October CMS

This plugin for October CMS integrates with the [RealFaviconGenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) service to generate and manage all the necessary favicons and HTML code for your website, ensuring full compatibility across all modern browsers and platforms.

Forget about manually creating dozens of different icons. Upload a single master image and let the plugin do the heavy lifting.

## Features

- **Full Integration with RealFaviconGenerator.net API**: Automates the creation of favicons for desktop, iOS, Android, Windows, and more.
- **Intuitive Settings Page**: Easily manage your favicon settings from the October CMS backend.
- **Automatic Generation**: Creates all required files (`favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, Android icons, etc.) and the `site.webmanifest` file.
- **Conflict Scanner**: Includes a tool to scan your theme for existing favicon tags that could cause issues.
- **Simple Component**: Easily integrate all the favicon HTML code into your layouts with a single component.

## Installation

You can install this plugin from the October CMS Marketplace or using Composer.

### Via Marketplace

1. Go to the **Settings > System > Plugins** section in the administration panel of your project.
2. Search for **"Real Favicon Generator"** by Davox.
3. Click on the plugin to install it.

### Via Composer

Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your October CMS project, and run the following command:

```bash
php artisan plugin:install Davox.RealFavicon
```

## Configuration and Usage

Once the plugin is installed, follow these steps to generate your favicons:

#### Step 1: Initial Setup

1. In the administration panel, navigate to **Settings > CMS > Favicon Settings**.
2. First, you'll need a free API key. Get your key from your [RealFaviconGenerator Dashboard](https://realfavicongenerator.net/dashboard) and paste it into the **API Key** field.
3. Next, upload your **Master Picture**. For the best results, use a square PNG file of at least **512x512 pixels**.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Step 2: Generate Your Favicon

1. After saving the API key and master picture, the **"Generate favicon"** button will appear.
2. Click this button. You will be redirected to the `RealFaviconGenerator.net` website to finalize your icon set.
3. On their site, configure the appearance for all platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) to your liking.
4. When you are done, click the "Generate and install favicon" button on their site. You will be automatically redirected back to your October CMS backend. Your favicons are now installed in the `storage/app/media/favicon/` directory.


#### Step 3: Check for Conflicts

1. After the favicon set has been generated, a new button will become active: **"Scan theme for overlapping tags"**.
2. Click this button to scan your active theme files for any pre-existing favicon tags that might cause conflicts.
3. If any conflicts are found, the tool will report the exact **file and line number**, allowing you to safely remove the old tags manually.

## Displaying the Favicon

To display the favicons on your website, you must add the `faviconTags` component to the `<head>` section of your main Twig layout.

1. Open your main layout file (e.g., `/themes/your-theme/layouts/default.htm`).
2. Add the following line just before the closing `</head>` tag:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>{{ this.page.title }}</title>
        <meta name="description" content="{{ this.page.meta_description }}">

        {# ... other meta tags ... #}

        {# --- Add the component here --- #}
        {% component 'faviconTags' %}

    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```
The component will automatically inject all the necessary HTML code that was generated by RealFaviconGenerator.net.
